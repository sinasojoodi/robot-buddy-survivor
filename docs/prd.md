## **Product Features**

**Player Movement and Control System**: The game implements responsive character movement through arrow key inputs with smooth directional control and boundary collision detection. Players move across the game world with consistent speed values while the system prevents movement through solid blocks and maintains character positioning within defined world boundaries. The movement system provides immediate visual feedback through character position updates and maintains smooth animation frames at sixty frames per second.

**Resource Mining and Collection**: Players interact with the environment through proximity-based mining mechanics activated by spacebar input. The system detects nearby blocks within defined range values and initiates mining progress bars that fill based on tool effectiveness and block hardness calculations. Successfully mined blocks disappear from the world and add specific resource quantities to the player inventory. Different block types require varying amounts of time to mine and drop different resource types upon completion.

**Robot Companion System**: The game provides an autonomous robot companion that follows the player character and assists in combat situations. The robot maintains positioning relative to the player while avoiding collision with environmental obstacles. During combat encounters, the robot automatically targets nearby enemies and engages them with energy-based attacks. The robot system includes health management, energy consumption tracking, and upgrade capabilities through crafted items.

**Enemy Spawning and Combat**: The system spawns enemies at timed intervals with spawn rates and enemy types determined by current game level and day-night cycle status. Enemies include zombies, skeletons, creepers, endermen, and dragons, each with unique health values, damage outputs, movement speeds, and armor ratings. Combat occurs automatically when players or robots move within attack range of enemies. The system calculates damage based on weapon strength, applies armor reductions, and removes defeated enemies while generating resource drops.

**Crafting Interface**: Players access a comprehensive crafting menu through keyboard input that displays all available recipes with resource requirements and current inventory status. The interface shows which items can be crafted based on available resources and provides immediate feedback on resource shortfalls. Successful crafting consumes required resources and provides manufactured items including weapons, upgrades, and consumables. Each recipe includes specific resource combinations and produces items with defined mechanical effects.

**Level Progression System**: The game tracks enemy eliminations against target values required for level advancement. Each level specifies kill requirements that players must achieve to progress to more challenging content. Level advancement triggers world regeneration with increased difficulty parameters including higher enemy spawn rates, more dangerous enemy types, and improved resource availability. Player health is preserved across level transitions, maintaining strategic challenge and requiring careful health management throughout the entire game progression. The system provides clear progress indicators and immediate feedback when level requirements are met.

**Day-Night Cycle**: The game implements a continuous day-night transition that affects enemy behavior and visual presentation. Nighttime periods increase enemy spawn rates, provide speed bonuses to enemies, and alter the visual color palette to indicate changed conditions. The cycle operates on a fixed timer that continuously progresses throughout gameplay sessions and directly impacts strategic decision-making regarding resource gathering and combat engagement.

**Dynamic Block Placement System**: Players can strategically place collected blocks within the game environment to control enemy movement, create defensive structures, and generate additional harvestable resources. The system allows cycling through available block types based on current inventory and level requirements using keyboard controls. Block placement occurs above the player position with collision detection preventing placement in occupied spaces. The feature adds tactical depth by enabling players to create barriers, redirect enemy paths, establish defensive positions, and strategically place valuable blocks for future mining to expand resource availability beyond the automatically generated environment. This creates a resource multiplication strategy where players can invest current materials to generate future harvesting opportunities.

**Health and Resource Management**: Players must manage character health, hunger levels, and robot energy throughout gameplay sessions. Health decreases through enemy attacks and hunger depletion, while hunger reduces continuously over time. Robot energy depletes through movement and combat actions and affects robot performance when low. The system provides visual indicators for all resource levels and allows restoration through specific crafted items and natural regeneration.

## **Technical Requirements**

The product requires implementation within a React application using modern JavaScript standards and browser-compatible technologies.
